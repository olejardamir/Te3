In attempting to describe an intervention where such skills can flourish this research outlines a small-scale study on implementing meta-cognitive strategies for students of English as a foreign language (EFL).
The results indicated that throughout this small intervention the learners grew an explicit awareness of the reflective process or the reflective cycle.
This lack of reflective attitude came to my attention when I had to constantly reflect on lectures, in my Masters programme.
In each classroom there might be approximately 10 to 12 students and sometimes there might be even more.
The rationale behind choosing reflection as a meta- cognitive skill will be described in the next section.
Similarly at later stages, listening to students voices and opinions aids teachers to reflect and make changes in the way they teach.
The purpose of this dissertation is also to find out the views of students about their reflective experience and afterwards to what extent they have found the reflective process useful.
This section introduces the skills of planning, monitoring and evaluation.
As a matter of fact, the notion of metacognition developing from social interactions has linked metacognition to the broader issue of self-regulated learning (Larkin, 2010: 13).
((reading the question)) 02 we learnt to work together, 03 M: help someone to work better 04 P: manage our time 05 M: help each other 06 P: * do group work and listen to each others ideas* 07 M: we need to pay more attention to the planning part 08 because it is more general and more important *because 09 the bases of the rest of the stages are dependent on 10 this stage* 11 P: *and the writing is needed to be done together 12 and with our joint ideas* 13 M: *it means it shouldnt just be one persons idea* 14 P: and when our work is done we need to review it to see 15 if it is done correctly and if we have made a mistake 16 we can correct it 17 M: and check the grammar and dictation Parsa (line 01) explains they have learnt to work collaboratively.
Mahdi includes that they have also learnt how to help each other out (line 02).
Extract C: 29 T: which part you didnt like much?
This was to illustrate how far the social interaction was apparent in practice and to find the existence of meta-cognition in the pairs joint working process (Iiskala et al., 2004).
These examples from extract A and B and the numerical evidence show how the learners were trying to construct the task together and help each other out.

The students also handed in neater projects (Appendix 8, p: 96).
This assertion might in fact be true as students from this research, who took part in all the activities mentioned above, were instilled with the motivation to take responsibility for their own learning.
By this I mean that the reflective framework could have come across as interesting to the learners as it was new to them, and that this could be a reason for why this research received the level of cooperation and enthusiasm as it did.
A: and then the teacher knows what to do and she can help us with our problems.* N: *it is also good for the teacher when she knows for example this student has a problem in grammar she can work more on that* 5. 4. Limitations It is essential to emphasize that there were some limitations and methodological problems with this research.

- How can they work together on one book?
- What would you change/ improve if they could do this project again - What would your advice be to other students who want to do the project - Any other ideas?
Step 2 monitoring stage 30 min - At this stage the students prepare the magazine the way they like - While they are performing the task you need to ask them some questions such as: ( *note: find a good timing to ask the questions) - How are you doing so far?
If they are struggling to express ideas in English it is okay to use L1 If possible from time to time refer to the cards 2.1.3.
Why yes?
Why not?
- What would you change/ improve if you could do this project again?
- Any other ideas?
- How can you work together on one wall paper?
If they are struggling to express ideas in English it is okay to use L1 If possible from time to time refer to the cards 2.1.3.
- Get feedback on some of them you do not need to check all their answers.
Why yes?
Why not?
- What would you change/ improve if you could do this project again?
- Any other ideas?
Preparation: - Tell them you are going to watch some parts of their videos - Ask why do you think you are going to watch it?
(do they think they were getting better at any stages (plan-do review) ask them to provide examples from the video - let them watch the third session and comment again on the way they think and plan, monitor and evaluate - Ask can you notice any differences about the way you worked in the first and last session?
Reflection - Stop the videos and ask - Do you like to always plan first and then do, and then review your plans?
Why yes?
Why not?
(example: mathematics, geography, English, science and etc.) - How?
In the frame of my master course, I am interested in doing a research on helping students to think of their own learning which is a 21 st century essential skill..
Why yes?
Why not?

P: we learnt to work together, M: help someone to work better P: *manage our time* M: * help each other* P: * do group work and listen to each others ideas* M: we need to pay more attention to the planning part because it is more general and more important because the bases of the rest of the stages are dependent on this stage* P: *and the writing is needed to be done together and with our joint ideas* M: it means it shouldnt just be one persons idea* T; *why do you think it is important to have your ideas both?* P: *because if he is writing something wrong I can stop him and make it better* and when our work is done we need to review it to see if it is done correctly and if we have made a mistake we can correct it* M: and check the grammar and dictation P: what part did you enjoy most and why?
