Now, I am sympathetic to at least part of what I understand these people to be saying.
Now, lets get on with the pursuit of our truly musical purposes.7 I put this in the provocative way I do because I think that at the heart of the matter lies a set of assumptions about the nature and value of music that wrongly segregates the truly musical from things with which music may somehow become associated (the words intrinsic and extrinsic are the surgical tools commonly used for these purposes).

I am reminded, in a way, of the peaceful tranquility of the time my wife and I spent in places like Ljubljana, Belgrade, Zabreb, and Sarajevo, some 35 years ago when the region was still known as Yugoslavia.
But those frictions did and do clearly matter, however convenient it may have been for Marshall Tito (and me) to dismiss them; and the harmonious beauty of the Balkan musics I cherish clearly belies the hatred among many of those whose musics they are.

But there is an important element of truth here, and what I do want to ask is how and why it is we appear to find ourselves in this situation.

In the case of music education, we are concerned on the one hand to establish that its professional knowledge differs in substantive, even profound ways from that of educators in general, such that not just anyone who teaches, or who is certified to do so, can rightly claim music educator status.

My further concern, to keep us on track here, is that such exclusions, essential though they may be, cannot be made as cleanly and neatly as we might like to think: They cannot be made with surgical precision.
Our conceptions of instructional method and of musicianship are both culturally- and practice- specific, which is to say that they favor and privilege method and musicianship of certain kinds, while excluding others.
Rethinking Professionalism in Music Education Action, Criticism, and Theory for Music Education 6/4: 109-131.
The musicianship widely presumed essential to the skill sets of music education professionals, however, is musicianship of a very specific kind.
Our instructional methods have evolved in service of practices rooted in the same kinds of priorities and values.
It is all very neat.

We are thus relieved of the difficulty of engaging otherness on both musical and human levels.

I think we need to learn to think of musics as fundamentally social phenomena;16 as actions and events that are always and intimately and constitutively connected to the lives and identities of people.
To declare musics beauty or its supposedly aesthetic qualities the essence of musicthat is, to say that these more than anything are what matter in understanding and teaching musicis not just a philosophical preference or predilection but a political act with far reaching consequences for concerns like equity and social justice.
How ironic, then, that we should find ourselves speaking of social justice as though it were something in which music is incidentally, tangentially, or optionally implicated.
Rethinking Professionalism in Music Education Action, Criticism, and Theory for Music Education 6/4: 109-131.
And what I hope you will wrestle with is the idea that issues of social justice should not really require such situating because theyve been there all along, albeit hidden behind our venerable assumptions and affirmative talk about the intrinsic, inherent, or aesthetic value of our music, and the aims and range of our instructional endeavors.

The crisis social justice creates is also one rich with potential to transform and reconfigure our discipline.
In the music education literature, consult Julia Kozas (1994a) Aesthetic Music Education: Discourses of Exclusion and Oppression, and her (1994b) Getting a Word in Edgewise: A Feminist Critique of Choral Methods Texts; Robert Lambs (1994) Aria Senza Accompagnamento: A Woman Behind the Theory; and Patricia OTooles (2005) Why Don't I Feel Included in These Musics, or Matters.

What I would like to urge in this latter regard, however, is that we resist the temptation to reify social justice to think of it as an entity or a state.
(Bowman 2000).
One of the main concerns of this essay is precisely the necessity of acknowledging and dealing responsively/responsibly with difference with meanings multiplicity, with the consequences of our actions, and so on.
9 I put it this way intentionally: In my view, the professionalization of music education is a task that remains to be accomplished.

These considerations work hand in hand with the myth of aesthetic insularity (inherency, intrinsicality) to assure that social justice remains a marginal consideration.
20 In case my point isnt perfectly clear, making hires into music teacher education programs contingent upon x, y, or z years (a number that continues to escalate) of successful experience in the schools assures that the purview of the profession remains the purview of those who have been there and done that.

The wrong warrants may be chosen; but grounding decisions in deliberation rather than convention and habit introduces at least the possibility that demonstrable commitments to socially just practices will be among the criteria by which professional (elite) status is conferred.
