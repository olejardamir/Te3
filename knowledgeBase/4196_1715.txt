In 1917, external examinations were introduced in secondary schools, and music was given a low status along with domestic science, art and handicraft.
A view of music as a specialist subject, practised by those with talent, or understood only by those who play an instrument, still persists.
The findings of these two investigations almost twenty-five years apart, therefore, highlight similar issues: that it is not always practical and not necessarily desirable for all primary music to be taught by a specialist, but that the generalist primary teacher may require support in order to teach music effectively.
From September 2000, primary teachers will again be required to teach the full range of subjects when a new National Curriculum is introduced, with reduced, less prescriptive programmes of study.
The questionnaire investigates levels of confidence in music teaching, as well as different aspects of music teaching, training and teacher support.
Ward is of the opinion that music should be taught by a single class teacher, arguing that the teacher's own musical skills, as well as their general teaching skills, can be sufficient to enable children to learn (p.26).
At a personal level, they take the view that music relates to everyday life and that people use it frequently, choosing it for various purposes such as dancing and relaxation.
While Kodaly's musical education method centres around singing, that of Orff is based principally on improvisation, using rhythm, natural speech patterns, physical activities such as clapping and stamping, as well as the use of pitched instruments, for example xylophones and glockenspiels.
(Art, Design and Technology, English, Geography, History, Maths, Music, PE, RE, Science) Question 2 was designed to investigate how confident teachers feel about teaching music.
Similarly, question 7(c) is designed to investigate whether teachers are more confident with informal, experiential teaching methods.
Does it enable you to teach music to your satisfaction?
Did you have enough time to think about your answers?
Did you feel under pressure to say more than you wanted to?
Fifteen schools were initially asked to participate.
I did not think it appropriate to send further copies of the questionnaire, as the head teachers would also be unaware of which teachers had or had not returned the questionnaires.
The high proportion of the teachers in the sample who taught music to their own classes is illustrated by the table below.
As Beauchamp (1997) observed, it would seem safe to assume that, given the many changes in initial training methodology even in the last f if ty years, their experiences of Music training are not the same (p.73).
Question 3(c) was therefore treated in isolation, as an investigation of respondents musical subject knowledge as opposed to training for musical teaching.

Comments made by interviewees indicate a greater confidence with basic things - rhythm and listening to sounds you can make with instruments', and that people are more comfortable with rhythm and music appreciation.

Maxwell- Timmins (1986) stresses the importance of teaching skills.
One of the other interviewees taught in this school and her comments supported this view: The peripatetic teacher does pitch etc, so I don't worry too much as she covers it.
A possible explanation is that as some respondents have music taught to their class in addition to or instead of their own teaching, they do not develop their own confidence in the subject.
(1997), 14, pp.69-85 OFSTED (1995) Music - A Review of Inspection Findings 1993-94, London: HMSO, p. 18 202 CHAPTER EIGHT CONCLUSION Primary schools are largely staffed by generalist teachers, and most are expected to teach all areas of the curriculum.
The present study confirms earlier findings that there is lower teacher confidence in music compared with other subjects of the National Curriculum.

I do need some record of the interview, and to avoid using a tape recorder which I thought could be offputting, I will be making some notes while we talk.
