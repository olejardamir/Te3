Introduction It is important to bear in mind that public schools are not solely academic institutions, and music as organized sounds shouldnt be the only focus of music educators.
For example, a 2006 report from the 2 National Endowment for the Arts indicates that people who are engaged in the arts are more active in their communities (National Endowment for the Arts); Robert Putnam found a positive correlation between community arts engagement and honest and effective civic governance in his 1993 study of Italy (Putnam 1993); and Stern and Seifert, who studied Philadelphia neighborhoods for a decade, found that active engagement in community arts was a predictor of community revitalization in several measurable ways, including increased ethnic diversification (Stern 2001, 2002, n.d.).
3 Amateur Musicing Of Americans Fifty-two percent of American households reported in a 2006 Gallup poll that they have at least one person, age 5 or older, who currently plays a musical instrument (NAMM 2006, 111).
The extant literature addresses teacher preparation models where Preservice teachers learn through participation in popular music ensembles or as a component of existing methods classes (Boespflug 1999; Ferguson 2006; Jones & Clements 2006).
Status of Secondary Instrument Class Offerings To determine the extent to which these instruments are taught in Preservice programs, I reviewed the secondary instruments class requirements of ten selected universities across the US in 2007.
The degree programs included were for initial certification.
This is an unhealthy situation that must be changed for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is preparing Preservice teachers to serve the social missions of public schools.
Students who pursue the MAT already have bachelor degrees in music.
The MAT curriculum includes discrete courses in the standard band and orchestra instruments, as well as acoustic guitar and electronic drum-set.
In addition, they have coursework in music education technology, digital/audio recording, conducting and rehearsal techniques for classical and jazz ensembles, private 11 lesson pedagogy, teaching improvisation, and performing and arranging for bucket drums and hand bells.
This is all in addition to courses in music education foundations, site- based elementary and secondary methods, and student teaching.iii Preparing music educators to offer a wider range of instruments, genres, and ensembles and foster lifewide and lifelong musicing will require us to reevaluate and reconfigure current offerings, develop some different secondary instruments classes, ensemble experiences, and other courses, and perhaps jettison others.
It will also require us to provide professional development opportunities for in-service teachers and to engage with music educator associations in order to help them move beyond current paradigms and also to pave the way for graduates who have been more broadly prepared.
The major resistances alumni of this program have faced are traditionalist expectations of fellow music teachers and music educator associations, not resistance from students, parents, or administrators.
