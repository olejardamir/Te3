Promoting a positive school climate should therefore be considered a fundamental part of school development planning.
Existing studies on the job satisfaction and occupational stress of teachers focus on teacher background characteristics (age, gender, years of service, etc.) as well as workplace conditions (organisational culture, pupil behaviour, work-load, etc.).
Examination of the nature of principalship and the factors that contribute to job satisfaction can provide a better understanding of their job, a topic particularly relevant with regard to 1 Some research on job satisfaction and occupational stress has been conducted as part of post-graduate studies (Masters and PhD theses), but not in recent years.
The GUI study was not specifically designed to explore levels of occupational stress and job satisfaction among teachers and principals.2 As a result, it has some limitations in terms of being confined to the responses of teachers teaching 9 year old children and in not collecting data specifically intended to capture potential stressors.
The report presents a literature review on teacher job satisfaction and stress.
It provides a descriptive analysis of factors (teacher background as well as institutional characteristics) that may have an impact on job satisfaction and occupational stress.
The study will address the following questions: 1. What background variables (gender, age, qualifications, years of experience, etc.) are likely to impact on job satisfaction among primary school teachers and principals in Ireland?
Overall, the factors that have been found to impact on the job satisfaction of teachers and principals can be divided into three broad categories: micro level (teacher background factors); meso level (school- level factors); and macro level (factors associated with society and the education system).
Teachers age and experience were also identified as factors in a study by Perie and Baker (1997) in the US, which found that in public schools, younger and less experienced teachers had higher levels of satisfaction than older and more experienced teachers, while in private schools, the relationship was different - the very youngest and very oldest teachers had the highest levels of satisfaction as did the least and most experienced teachers.
Male teachers reported more stress than their female counterparts in relation to professional tasks and pupil behaviour/ attitude.
The gender gap in professional satisfaction grew with increased teaching competence.
In addition to school type and location, workplace conditions have been found to impact on the job satisfaction of teachers.
Perie and Baker (1997) identified the following school-level/working condition factors associated with teacher satisfaction: administrative support and leadership, student behaviour and school atmosphere, relations with parents, and teacher autonomy (their sense of control over classroom procedures).
Negative associations were found between job satisfaction and occupational stress.
In addition, Kyriacou (2001: 31) highlighted the positive impact of working in a school with a positive climate in terms of social support.
The former refers to things that teachers can do that eliminate the source of stress, including identifying the source of stress and then carrying out some form of action to combat this (ibid.: 30).
Teaching-specific stress was associated with: lack of time to spend with individual pupils, large classes, noisy pupils, difficult classes, and pupil motivation.
The analysis draws on data collected for Growing Up in Ireland study.
Growing Up in Ireland is a national study of 9 year old children, the main aim of which is to paint a full picture of children in Ireland and how they are developing in the current social, economic and cultural environment.
Because satisfaction levels are high among both teachers and principals, the following analyses focus on teacher-level and school-level factors associated with being very satisfied.
8 A significance level of p<.001 means that the likelihood is less than one in a thousand that this relationship would occur by chance.
In keeping with the patterns shown for age-group, the most recently recruited teachers (that is, those who have joined the school in the past five years) show the highest satisfaction levels, with satisfaction levels reaching a plateau among those who have been in the school for longer.
There is a sizable literature on the effects of school size.
Principals who taught a class had somewhat lower satisfaction levels than administrative principals, with 42 per cent describing themselves as very satisfied compared with 54 per cent of administrative principals (p<.001).

whether the school is designated disadvantaged or not).9 Teachers were asked to indicate whether these statements were true for nearly all the pupils (in the school), more than half or less than half.
In comparison, 93 per cent of principals felt satisfied (either very or fairly) with their job, whereas 70 per cent of principals felt stressed (Figure 9a).
Teachers of all sampled 9 year olds were interviewed for the study.
Promoting a positive school climate should therefore be considered a fundamental part of school development planning.
This is the first systematic analysis of the individual, classroom and school factors shaping job satisfaction and stress among teachers and principals across very different primary school settings.
