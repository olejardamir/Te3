Appreciating individual and cultural differences has become a goal of American society.
As they do, they should acquire a more complex and invigorating sense of the worldand of themselves.
Results from the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP), for instance, has shown that the reading and math skills of Black and Hispanic children are substantially below those of White children at each of grades four, eight, and twelve (Beaton, 1986; NAEP, 1996).
What does this mean for teachers, who will be expected to maintain high achievement although more students are enrolling from culturally diverse backgrounds?
Specifically, the student population, 61,409 was characterized by a percentage breakdown that included 49.70 percent White, 44.60 percent Black, 1.20 percent Asian, 1.60 percent Hispanic, 1.10 percent American Indian and 1.80 percent other.
Whether teachers race and ethnicity directly affect student achievement remains unanswered.
Viadero (1996) projected a decline of white children in the nations classrooms by the year 2000, while the nations teaching force remains overwhelming White and a trend analysis reflect that it likely will become more so.
11 The dimension typology (Darling-Hammond, 1993) is an ideal-type conception.
Multicultural education also prescribes what should be done to ensure equitable accessibility and treatment for diverse groups in schools and in the society as a whole (Baptiste, 1986).
Spradley and McCurdy (1975), defined culture as the acquired knowledge that people use to interpret experience and to generate social behavior.
This self-assessment should help determine which dimensions of multicultural education are being implemented in our schools.
Teachers and students can be mismatched in teaching and learning styles, which will disadvantage both parties.
Cooperative learning, an instructional strategy that involves students helping one another in a small-group setting, appears to be an effective strategy, which also provides students an opportunity to develop academically as well as socially.
Curriculum 20 content and material can be evaluated, updated, and instructional strategies and methods can be expanded.
These teaching examples serve many functions simultaneously.
But more than gaining knowledge about the cultural characteristics of specific groups, we need to help teachers attain a process for 25 looking at the American experience so that they can raise questions.
27 2. If textbooks are used to teach writing, spelling, mathematics, science and music, the teacher will need to supplement them with relevant materials.
The definitions for the five factor model were clearer than the definitions for the four factor model.

When I was in college seeking out experiences with different groups of people, it was interesting, exciting and sometime scary because of the prejudices that I had developed growing up (group 1, 12/97).
They bring into the books a lot of multicultural differences in teaching so it can reach child (group 2, 12/97).
The major predictor of classroom behavior was the number of hours individuals received on multiculturalism.
It is possible that such teachers feel competent because they have limited experience with multicultural students.
Future researchers who use the MTS need to realize that it is limited in implicit explanation and does not explore what would make instruction and the teacher more compatible.
The survey data clearly shows that more multicultural education will result in instructional changes, and this was also supported by the focus group data.
2. Apply a multicultural perspective to the subject content of the curriculum and use instructional techniques and strategies that address varied learning styles and preferences.

(group 2, 12/97).
I think something that helped me is we have, in our grade tried to use as many community resources as we could (teacher, focus group 2, 12/97).
You can get more resources if you actually interact with different cultures that are in your community (group 1, 12/97).
When I was in college seeking out experiences with different groups of people, it was interesting, exciting and sometime scary because of the prejudices that I had developed growing up (group 1, 12/97).
Through volunteering, I met a lot of different people....they would talk about wars or their family situation and then I would interact with their children (group 1, 12/97).
