Johnson (2010) did not speak directly to educators, but there is much to be gleaned from examples of creative best practices when planning and enacting inquiry-learn- ing contexts that hope to achieve such high-level learning outcomes.
Shore, Birlean, Walker, Ritchie, LaBanca, and Aulls (2009) defined inquiry-literacy and outlined vignettes of what inquiry can look like in science, social studies, and mathematics.
5, No. 1, Autumn 2011 215 The Impact of Emotions on Divergent Thinking Processes: A Consideration for Inquiry-Oriented Teachers reported were interpreted to be due to the personal investment required to engage creatively, to put themselves into their schoolwork in a way not typically required of them.
Lack of evidence cer- tainly does not call into question the existence or importance of studying the creative process.
What is the advantage of understanding emotions influences on divergent thinking?
How does the above theory apply to teaching and learning?
Activities that evoke positive emotions, such as interest, joy, and excitement, are hypothesized to broaden students thought-ac- tion repertoires and lead to student-directed creative endeavors.
It is not our goal LEARNing Landscapes | Vol.
Having an eye for detail and a narrow focus might be beneficial for some specific tasks involved in the research process, but innovation cannot be achieved without the divergent thinking hypothesized to be more likely during positive than negative emotion states.
A Neurocognitive Research Study in the Making We are in the beginning stages of collecting data for a study that we de- scribe briefly here in order to exemplify how we can test the above directional hy- potheses using neurocognitive methods.
Emotions extraneous to the assigned conditions will be used as a covariate in the analysis of results.
If a word incongruent with the first word is presented (coffee, then socks), there will be a negative volt- age detected through EEG at approximately 400 milliseconds.

What about combing your hair, using it as a paintbrush to create texture in a painting, cleaning a gritty surface, re- shaping it to make jewelry, bending some prongs to make a place-card holder at the dinner table, or hanging many together to make a wind chime?
We expect that participants in positive moods will see the shades of greyit is hypothesized they will see that some words are more or less related to other words.
Using a visual analog scale to make judgments of congruency in an ERP experiment is a new and more ecologically valid method for assessing divergent thinking.

An awareness of this aspect of the student experience can help teachers better understand their learners, which will undoubtedly facilitate ones ability to support them through the inquiry process.
Having awareness of the emotional experiences of students will help teachers be able to give students the guidance and support they need to think creatively.
However, the critical first step in this endeavor is interdisciplinary collaboration in which expertise from both areas is combined.
If we want to integrate neuroscience and education, sending information between education and neuroscience across bridges is not the answer.
Sim- ply taking results and interpretations of (cognitive) neuroscience, relating them to an educational context, and then drawing conclusions for educa- tion does not integrate the two disciplines.

5, No. 1, Autumn 2011 227 Theorizing an Integration of Reading and Mathematics: Solving Mathematical Word Problems in the Elementary Grades William H. Rupley, Robert M. Capraro, & Mary Margaret Capraro, Texas A&M University ABSTRACT This article theorizes three major cognitive constructs that are operationally defined by shared similarities of processing information in reading and mathematics.
14, 2009) There has been no significant change in the performance of the nations 4th-graders in mathematics from 2007 to 2009, a contrast to the progress seen from 1990 to 2007 at that grade level and subject, according to the 2009 National Assessment Governing Board (2009) in math- ematics.
However, this innovation was questioned when in international student comparisons the U.S. performance did not improve (Baroody, 1989; cf. Clements & McMillen, 1996).
They computed effect sizes and also provided a descrip- tion of the context, design, and findings of each experimental study.
The most promising conclusion to assist with theoretical reformation from Slavin and Lake was the effect for programs that targeted teachers instructional behaviors (ES = + 0.33) rather than the content of the programs.

They reported one statistically significant effect for the six reading programs examined (LeapTrack, 4th grade).
Perspectives on Previous Theories Several models have been suggested that account for the nexus of reading and mathematics.
