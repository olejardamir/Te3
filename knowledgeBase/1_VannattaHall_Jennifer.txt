Early childhood teachers who have had less than successful music experiences may doubt their confidence in their own content knowledge and ability to teach music.
In general, under NCLB a highly qualified teacher must: (a) hold a bachelors degree; (b) have full state certification, as defined by the state; and (c) demonstrate competency, as defined by the state, in each core academic subject he or she teaches (U.
Two strands of research examining the construct and measurement of teacher efficacy exist in the literature (Tschannen-Moran et al., 1998).
Preparing for the Study Several initial steps were taken in preparation for this research.
Music for Young Children (Andress, 1998) is the required textbook for the course.
Microteachings Microteaching is an instrument for teacher training.
The researcher also recorded all comments regarding confidence and competence to teach music.
If this is the case, think about the 12 months when you were most musically active and answer the following questions about that year.
The difference between pre- to mid-scores was not significant.
136 Previous Music Experiences The researcher used the responses from the Music Background Survey (MBS) to organize participants based on their reported music experiences prior to taking the music methods course.
Observation was a major component of the music methods course.
Observations of Music Specialist Participants observed the elementary music specialist at the university lab school teach four lessons throughout the semester.
Furthermore, performance of tasks during the field experience allows pre-service teachers to have practical personal experience that contributes to the development of self-efficacy (Bleicher, 2007).
