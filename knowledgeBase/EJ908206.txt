Tertiary educators continue to be challenged when preparing pre-service teachers with the necessary knowledge, skills and understanding to become primary teachers as they are expected to teach across all curriculum areas.
Australian Journal of Teacher Education Vol 35, 3, May 2010 76 Southcott and Hartwig (2005) note that for the Arts and specifically for music, there is only generic language with little real information to guide the teacher (p.147).
During this experience she moved from student identity to teacher identity in what she calls putting theory into practice and thinking on your feet.
Her identity formation as a pre-service teacher aligns with Wengers (1998) construction of Australian Journal of Teacher Education Vol 35, 3, May 2010 77 identity as an experience in terms of engagement, imagination and alignment.
It is thought that the preparation of teaching is two pronged whereby it is solely the duty of the university to teach theory and the school is generally the site where the actual practice takes place (Henry 2001).
The involvement in the profession helps pre-service teachers move towards full membership of the profession, these components become progressively interrelated as they use these principals to inform their pedagogical practice (Sutherland, Scanlon & Sperrign, 2004, p.80).
It can be argued if pre-service students experience and engage with music teaching and learning constructively during their tertiary education, then, they may teach Australian Journal of Teacher Education Vol 35, 3, May 2010 78 constructively (Bleicher & Lindgren, 2002).
As part of the degree, students have to undertake a minimum of 80 days supervised school experience (placement) over the duration of the course.
ECA409 is shared between Visual Arts and Music during the 10-week semester.
In ECA409 students gain an understanding of basic music teaching approaches, which focus on creative music making, (graphic notation and staff notation), singing, classroom instrument performance, listening, moving to music and playing the recorder.
In ECA410, semester 2, students choose one focused study (dance, drama, music and visual arts) as their core unit and attend approximately 8 weeks of semester.
The music focused study called Masakhane: Music in the making centers on preparing students as non-specialist teachers of classroom music at the primary school level.
Reflective practice in teacher education is an important element of professional preparation as Russell (2005) points out.
Brookfield (1995) points out that reflection can be seen through four possible lenses: the practitioners own writings about their experiences as learners and teachers (autobiographies); the learners eyes; the colleagues eyes and experiences; and existing theoretical literature (p.29).
Through dialogue with the classroom teacher when on school placement and with myself and fellow peers at the university, the pre-service teacher comes to know themselves and others as they construct their professional identity.
In groups, during the workshop time, they prepare and experiment with graphic notation and sounds using conventional (xylophones, shakers, bells etc) and non conventional (water bottle, keys, window blinds etc) sounds.
As non-music specialists they are concerned about what works and how to do it in a real class, which is reiterated by Goodlad (1990) who points out that pre-service teachers are concerned with being able to do it (p.214).
According to Wiggins (2007), when students experience good learning programs, coupled with appropriate scaffolding (i.e., support) from peers and teacher they understand the links between theory and practice in more sophisticated ways (p.36).
The voices of my students and the questions they ask continue to inform my knowledge about teaching.
Listening to their stories and reflecting in, on and with them has reinforced the value of collaboration and reduced isolation that can so often accompany music teaching (Robbins, Burbank and Dunkle, 2007, p.52).
I intermitted my fourth and final placement in that year and chose to undertake my school placements in 2009.
I spent both of my 15-day placements (in March and July) at this small school with only 8 teachers and on average 120 students.
I also reflected on my classroom management techniques and strategies to combat various challenging behaviours in the classroom.
Watching my peers at the university prepare and present their compositions also expanded my tools to compose and make music.
Even though the ECA410 focus was African music making, Orff, Kodly and Dalcroze, I was able to transfer those pedagogies when my students learnt and created songs based on Australian Indigenous music.
This reinforces Russell-Bowies (2006) perspective that however unmusical teachers think they are, if they are committed to their children, have a positive and enthusiastic attitude and are keen to learn, they can succeed in implementing music lessons in their classroom (p.45).
In both ECA409 and ECA410 we also learnt of ways to approach ongoing assessment through keeping observational and anecdotal notes of student learning and behaviour.
It is also interesting for both my students and I to talk about how the classroom teacher when on placement gave them feedback on how to teach and improve on their delivery and content knowledge.
It is hoped that during the music workshops the pre-service teacher develops a repertoire of attributes for their own practice in relation to pedagogy, content, student learning and classroom management.
