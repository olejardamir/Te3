Regrettably, there are a variety of weaknesses in the 14-19 period of education and the Governments White Paper, 14-19: opportunity and excellence, is an attempt to remedy these problems.
Reforming Further Education and Training (Department for Education and Skills, discussion document, June 2002).
The A Level marking debacle of 2002 undermined confidence in A2 Levels in particular, while ever increasing pass rates have undermined respect for A Levels in general.
Pupils should continue to sit for GCSEs, but for those who find them unchallenging the Government needs to consider allowing schools to offer such pupils an opportunity to work towards a more demanding qualification.
A smaller proportion of pupils should achieve an A grade at A Level, otherwise the grade loses distinction.

Indeed, 5% of pupils fail to achieve any GCSEs at all.14 Many school children proceed through compulsory education without acquiring basic literacy and numeracy skills.

In 2000/01, 5.5% of pupils in their last year of compulsory schooling failed to achieve a single GCSE, 19.4% of pupils only managed to obtain one or more GCSEs at grades D-G and 24.1% of pupils secured one to four passes at grades A* - C.23 More generally, the Government fears that GCSEs have been transmogrified into two separate qualifications: Level 2 (grades A* - C) is regarded as a success, but Level 1 (grades D G) is seen as a failure.24 In short, the GCSE qualification has not been a success in catering for students of differing abilities.
Moreover, suspicions abound that GCSE examinations have become easier over time.
However, the improvement in GCSE results has been much more dramatic.

However, it is also possible that A Level examinations have become easier.

As a consequence of the first of his reports, 1,953 A and AS Level entry grades were revised.45 The second review resulted in Tomlinson recommending a number of reforms to the A level system, in particular that AS and A2 Levels become separate 37 R. Lea, Education and training.

In fact, one in four 16-18 year olds abandoned education and training at the end of 2000, a figure notably higher than the OECD and EU averages.56 However, this does represent an improvement on past performance: in 1978 56% of 17-18 year olds in the UK were not participating in either education or training, compared to just 21% in West Germany.57 Using a different measurement, 88% of 15-19 year-olds in Germany were in education and training in 2001, compared to 72.5% of the same age group in the UK.58 The Government blames the high drop out rate amongst school pupils from education and training on a combination of factors including: an assumption that leaving school at 16 is natural; disaffection with study at school and a preference to be at work; financial circumstances; and poor advice.59 Relatively low rates of participation in education and training in the post-16 phase probably has the effect of leaving the UK with a comparatively less skilled workforce in relation to many other OECD countries.

For example, teachers and pupils might be tempted to opt for easier GCSEs in order to hit the new targets.
With regards to post-16 general or academic qualifications, for the time being the Government intends to retain both the AS Level and the A2 Level (but see below).
However, the Government has sensibly decided to drop a proposal that it made in the Green Paper on education for 14-19 year olds that it should be possible to achieve an A grade at A2 with distinction, over and above the straight forward A grade.67 This move would have amounted to a de facto admission that grade inflation had taken place.
Although the Government has decided to retain GCSEs, AS Levels and A Levels for the time being, their long term prospects are uncertain.
Most employers would have still wanted to know what GCSEs and A Levels prospective employees had, not whether they had been awarded a Matriculation Diploma at a particular level.
These new qualifications might also enhance participation rates in post-16 education and training if students enjoy studying for them and if they consider them to be beneficial.
Parity of esteem between vocational education and general or academic education is ultimately to be achieved by developing well respected courses and qualifications.
Turning to GCSEs, on balance the Government is right to retain this set of examinations for pupils to work towards at the end of Key Stage 4. GCSEs give pupils an end goal for their studies.
With regards to AS Levels, the best course of action would be to abandon this exam altogether, which got off to a difficult start in 2001.
At the same time, the Government could encourage some schools to offer some of their post- 16 students the opportunity to take the International Baccalaureate (IB), provided that the results are given due weight in the school performance tables.

80 For example, the QCA initially defended a new test for Shakespeare for 14-year-old pupils that would have enabled students to achieve more than half the marks without showing any knowledge of the Bards plays.
Schools and colleges should consequently be able to choose which of these qualifications to offer their students.
This is for two basic reasons.

Welcome though the Governments reforms to the National Curriculum are, it could probably slim its content down still further.
Whether the teaching of Citizenship will succeed in doing this is another matter.
Above all, the flagship of the Governments vocational education programme the MA system suffers from three major deficiencies that must be rectified.
