Now, as I wandered through the quiet halls, it was impossible to ignore that something had definitely changed.
Music programs are being sacrificed in order to create more class time for subjects of greater significance, such as math and English, under the No Child Left Behind Act, signed in 2001.
The skills learned and the positive effects from music are ignored and overlooked, leaving the youth less prepared for a global job market which demands creative thinkers.
For example, English courses promote critical thinking skills through analyzing literature and writing.
Besides the skills that can be attained, there are other benefits that are manifested in the arts.
It would be terribly alarming and hypocritical for the United States to be characterized by people of the opposite persuasion: individuals without a voice, mindlessly, blindly following the leaders.
we depend on the arts to carry us toward the fullness of our humanity (Gerber 18).
They are worth learning for their own sake, providing benefits not available through any other means (19).
Not only does music provide general knowledge and creativity, but it can bridge the gaps between the fundamental learning of other disciplines.
The Kennedy Center, an organization devoted to research on arts education, stipulates that an integrated curriculum and instruction allows teachers to connect subjects, illuminating important topics, ideas, issues, and experiences along lines of convergence.
In addition, integrated approaches can stimulate new forms of cognition (A Place For Art).
Without music classes, each childs education will remain incomplete.
It is in each childs best interest for schools to promote creativity-inspiring classes such as music to complement other academic subjects such as math and English.
However, being involved with music can be very expensive with the costs of the instrument, music, lessons, and performances, so the leaders of Adams County have found a way to relieve the strain.
Terry Holliday has experience on both sides of the music education issue as a former band teacher and now a superintendant of a school district.
Schools will also pull struggling students with poor academic achievement out of music classes in order to give them double-periods in math or English.
If state school boards do not openly recognize the significance of music education and then create policy to protect it, music programs will continue to diminish.
However, it hardly seems that the reduction of enrollment can be deemed insignificant or discussed so nonchalantly.
In theory, this Act seemed to be a step in the right direction, but, once again, music education was deemed a trivial concern.
For this, students could complete the credit anytime between sixth and twelfth grade (Gerber 17).
It is understandable that not every student will have an interest in music; however, because of the clear benefits and its status as an element of a complete education, the music requirement should be more than just one class in seven years of schooling.
Music classes often are the losers of scheduling conflicts because of the greater emphasis on math and English.
In order to further the message of the 10 importance of academic courses, math and English have been incorporated into music classes.
Another point to consider when pursuing this issue is the opinions of the public.
The childrens best interest must be of the utmost importance.
