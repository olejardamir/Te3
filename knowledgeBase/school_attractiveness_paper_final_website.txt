Not to take that into account makes schools not just unattractive but irrelevant.
France, Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Norway) While these common drivers exist within the variety of school types, there are quite different ways that schools see the arts as contributing to school attractiveness.

Steiner and Montessori ).
Throughout Europe there are schools with priorities in the arts (Musikhauptschule), Magnet schools (in the US but also in the Netherlands) and schools in close cooperation with cultural institutions.
Some education systems or schools offer publicly-funded or publicly- subsidised arts activities outside school hours during lunch breaks, after school, at weekends or in school holidays.
do the arts have a role to play in making school systems more relevant to today's needs?).
Others might argue that a (small) turnover of teachers or greater staff and student retention rates may be a more accurate measure of attractiveness.
Intellectual development The Role of Arts Education in Enhancing School Attractiveness: a literature review by Anne Bamford and Michael Wimmer EENC Paper, February 2012 10 If we take each of these four characteristics in order, there is a body of evidence that supports the theory that the arts contribute positively to the choices made, at least the choices of parents and children.

There is little direct or indirect research between the arts and leadership development.
(Bill Mulford: School Leaders: Changing roles and impact on teacher and social effectiveness.
(Bender, Saskia, Kunst im Kern von Schulkultur sthetische Erfahrung und sthetische Bildung in der Schule, Wiesbaden, 2010) Other studies looked at ways school attractiveness may be enhanced through more culturally sensitive forms of teacher training or induction.
The arts can provide effective learning opportunities to the general student population, yielding increased academic performance, reduced absenteeism, and better skill-building.
Pupils were most likely to be (and feel) engaged where they had a sense of achievement, growth and enjoyment.
Under this definition, quality is considered to exist as something that may include achievements (i.e.
The UNESCO Road Map on Arts Education establishes 10 consistently held quality beacons.

Specifically, more research studies need to be conducted into: 1. The impact of the arts on school attractiveness in terms of attracting and retaining effective school leaders and quality teachers 2. The impact of the arts on school attractiveness in terms of pupil retention and reduction in school drop outs (reducing early school leaving) 3. The impact of the arts on school attractiveness in terms of improving employability and or community perceptions of pupils from particular school settings 4. The comparative impact of the arts on school attractiveness in terms of different school client groups such as those from different social classes, levels of aspiration, boys and girls, rural and/or city children, those with special education needs and so on.
(2006) found that there was no difference in social skills presented by children who did and did not take part in a structured multi- component arts programme targeted at low-income communities.
