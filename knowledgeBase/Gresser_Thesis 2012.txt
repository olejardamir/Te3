In a minority of primary schools often independent music is taught by specialists, who may have received postgraduate training in pedagogical techniques appropriate to primary education, although this is not always the case.
The importance of a strong music education, incorporating compositional and performance experience in primary school, is therefore seen as important and yet there are many concerns for the quality and even the existence of music education in primary schools today (Pascoe et al., 2005).
Although Pascoe et al.

6 Definition of terms For the purpose of this study, I have given these key terms the following definitions: Creative classroom environment: a classroom where children are able to express themselves creatively through music.

Russell-Bowie (2009) has conducted research in British, American and Australian school settings on the matter of teacher confidence and preparedness and its implications for classroom teaching.
Teachers who are not musically confident proceed to teach music inadequately in classrooms (Seddon & Biasutti, 2008) and therefore create a continuum of negative musical experiences for students who ultimately become teachers in this same unbreakable cycle (Jeanneret, 1995; Russell-Bowie, 2010).
5).
The view of oneself as an individual and more specifically, as a teacher, is 14 dynamic and ever-changing, dependent on the exposure to reflective and collaborative experiences (Hargreaves, Miell & Macdonald, 2002).
The extent to which the school environment, including experiences inside and outside the classroom, can change and influence the developing identities of students demonstrates the importance of teacher awareness of self and others (Hargreaves & Marshall; 2003; Lamont, 2002; Welch, Purves, Hargreaves & Marshall, 2010).
Classroom models and frames for musical creativity Suggestions for task design recognise active music-making as an avenue for the fostering of musical skills (Campbell, 2004; Clennon, 2009; Glover, 2000; Glover & Young, 1999; 16 Major & Cottle, 2010; Saetre, 2011; Wiggins, 1994a, 2003, 2009, 2011).
Research Design - Action Research This project adopts an action research approach, a commonly-used design in educational research as an ideal mechanism to effect change through participation (Cain, 2008; Denscombe, 1998).
Students in the school come from Lebanese, Korean, Chinese, Indian, Maori and Macedonian backgrounds.
However, over the course of the study their references to limited musical knowledge or talent decreased, indicating that this self-concept and teacher identity was changing.
Samantha: Which part of it made you feel like it was a funeral?
. . . Instead of just the free rein.
Maree: Yes, as soon as you did it, I thought yeah, there could be horses.
Because everyone is different.
Samanthas students (S2A) responded differently to the arrangement task, and although they were not instructed specifically to do so, many students changed key words within the overall lyric structure (see Figure 4.3).
They were more selective in how they did this (compare Figure 4.3 to the original lyrics in Appendix H).
So when you come to do a song thats a school-age song . . . they go boring . . . And I went hang on a minute, well its actually related to the unit of work were doing...
Also, the fact that the groups were all working in the same room resulted in students sharing ideas as they had no choice but to listen to the work of their peers on adjacent tables.
Something theyll be able to implement later on or relate.
What made music easier?
361) and, within this, the crucial role of the specialist music teacher must be understood: to provide consultancy to encourage generalists through integration, but also to take responsibility (with subject specific knowledge) for certain aspects of childrens musical development.
