(Aristoxenus, cited in Strunk, 1950, p. 31) But in our zeal to explain music, it has been tempting to forget the hypothetical and constructed nature of such categories and to imagine that it is these ideas themselves that have the power to produce our experience (Hasty, cited in M. P. Soulsby, et al, 2001, p. 3).
For example, in the quote that heads this chapter, the 4th century, B.C.E.
Enigmas and Organizing Constraints In confronting these enigmas of musical development, I will make a first and basic assumption: developing a hearing of a composition as it unfolds in time is a performance and performances (both silent and out-loud) involve a process of active, sense-making occurring in real-time.1 1 The basic sense of a hearing which I use throughout the chapter derives from common practice among musicians.

64).
It is not surprising that in the spirit of these traditional trajectories, musical developmental studies have typically focused on progress as meaning the capacities of children to abstract, name, measure, and hold musical elements constant (e.g., pitch, duration, interval) across changing contexts (For an overview of this research, see R. Shuter-Dyson, 1982.) In response, much early music instruction tends to give primary attention to musical literacy.

A View of Development As Learning 4 The passage begins (at P) in the key of G-sharp minor; the G natural in bar 216 is clearly a simplified way of writing F double-sharp, which, as the leading note, has an upwards attraction towards the tonic G sharp (m.
How does a performer benefit from the invariance of pitch class notation and still use it as a means for projecting change in functional musical meaning?
As an admittedly tentative first approximation, I propose that: Musical development is enhanced by continuously evolving interactions among multiple organizing constraints along with the disequilibrium and sensitivity to growing complexity that these entanglements entrain.
The final example shifts to much more complex music-- three students descriptions of their very different hearings of a Beethoven Sonata Movement.
Illustrating three phases in the course of musical learning and development, the differences among the hearings again embody tensions among organizing constraints seen already in nascent form in the childrens work.
For as there is no harmony in the strings save that which the cunning of the hand confers upon them, so is there none in the finger-holes save what has been introduced by the same agency.

That is, I resist a view of ...maturation as a passive process, instead ascribing to the notion that ...one can, under laboratory conditions, provoke development.
In working with participants in these task situations I make a beginning assumption: no matter how obscure or confused a childs actions, decisions, or descriptions may seem, there is reason in what he has done; it is my job to probe for and to find the sense made.

His actions are evidence that through immediate repetition, he implicitly recognized the integrity of motivic groupings, marking them and making them in action, as bounded entities.

The two bells were the same: Extracted from their embedded context along the action and bell paths, they were simply objects that sounded the samethey shared the same invisible property, pitch.
I asked: Well, since those brown and white bells you just played sound the same, I bet you could play HOT without the brown bell since you have a white one that matches it already.

In contrast, most musical novices of any age continue their initial organizing strategy by simply adding another G-bell, giving it unique function as the ending of the phrase and of the currently cumulating bell-path.5 Figure 6 Novice New event, new function, new G-bell Conan Giving G-bell a dual function Conans turn-back move, which already suggested his potential for invoking mixed organizing constraints, provoked a moment of direct confrontation between organizers.
He obviously expected to find the F-bell there--the next lower in the scale after G and the bell he needed for the next event in the tune.

With one critical move, Conans view of the line-up of unmarked bells had transformed from a row of uniquely situated, order-of-occurrence tune-events (C-G-A) to an invariantly ordered pitch series arranged high-to-low, right-to-left.

Composers, listeners, performers do not discard these common cultural organizing constraints, rather complexity, as I am using the term, is functionally dependent on them.
That is, these generative primitives are the scaffolding for the development of musical complexityboth its apprehension and its evolution as manifested in the working out of those compositions.
As the musicologist, Wolff, in his biography of the great pianist, Artur Schnabel, points out: The thematic material used by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven is very often no different than that used by lesser composers of the time, but as the material is developed..., it acquires its individual shape.

The argument seems to get resolved, here, but not happily.
This new sad tune makes up the second part [bars 20-25].
I also heard those three large parts, but it's more how Beethoven makes them that I'm paying most attentionto when Im playing.

Anya: You see, as a performer thinking about what I want the listener to experience, it just doesn't work if you reduce the whole process to a type or scheme so you can say, Oh yeah, it's one of those.
It's how we hear the finished product that's the point.
