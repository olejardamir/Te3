One way to achieve this is to systematically assess student achievement and routinely report this achievement to students and parents.
In March 1994, a consortium of professional arts education organizations recommended a set of National Standards for four areas of arts education: dance, drama, music, and visual arts.
Mark (1995) provided a brief history of how the arts came to be included in the Goals 2000 legislation.
For example, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, P.L.
The standards are designed to show the national consensus for the highest priority skills and knowledge that students should have acquired upon exiting grades 4, 8, and 12 (MENC, 1994c).
In fact, the standards help clarify what should be assessed (Shuler, 1996).
Many music teachers now use the national standards as guidelines for teaching and objectives for student learning.
For example, assessment can be used in education to guide the instructional process.
Taylor (2003) discussed several purposes of assessment, including assigning grades and sharing work with parents.
Assessment is an important part of the educational process and is used frequently in education to guide the instructional process, evaluate teacher effectiveness, measure student growth, and provide feedback on student achievement.
Direct observation provides the only means we have for evaluating some aspects of learning and development (Gronlund, 1976, p427).
Though they are time consuming, anecdotal records can provide a more detailed description of actual student behaviors than many other types of assessment (Gronlund, 1976).
Rubrics function as a general scoring guide that help students to understand their task, monitor their work, develop critical thinking skills, and self-assess their work (Taylor, 2003).
Rehearsals or performances can be recorded and reviewed later.
A summary of assessment related studies in music education show some significant findings but also reveals areas where research is still needed.
Niebur concluded that the teachers first priority in teaching was to provide students with powerful musical experiences.
Shih investigated the relationship between state music objectives and the objectives music educators reported teaching and assessing in the 5th grade general music classroom.
This study showed that all nine standards do not receive equal class time.
Robinson and Craver (1989) listed several different types of grading systems.
Their study on teacher beliefs about training in testing and measurement showed that 47% of the 397 participants believed their measurement training was somewhat or very inadequate.
The information could also help schools develop music teacher schedules that allow adequate time for planning and administering these assessments.
Conversely, it follows that teachers who are not using these strategies do not believe they received adequate training.
Shih (1997) also found that fifth grade general music teachers in central Texas considered effort to be more important than talent when assigning grades.
This study provides an important look at assessment of the National Standards for Music Education in the elementary general music classroom.

Surveys were sent to 619 elementary schools in Michigan with a forty-one percent return rate.
Teacher opinions on time, their own training in assessment, and the role of effort in assigning grades were found to have significant relationships with certain assessment strategies and standards.
