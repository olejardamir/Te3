Concerning prior musical experiences, the disparity in elementary education majors musical experience and ability is a specific challenge presented to teachers of university music methods courses.
Further, Barry insisted that the elementary music methods class must not only address the basic skills of music, it must address student attitudes and their perceived strengths and weaknesses (1992, p. 21).
From observing teachers and teaching, these students have beliefs about effective teaching and appropriate student behavior (Parjares, 1992).
Further, knowledge and beliefs are intertwined, yet a persons belief system acts as an affective filter through which new phenomenon are interpreted.
Chapter Four presents the results of data analysis for both quantitative instruments and the two qualitative procedures.
Berke and Colwell (2004) examined the self-reported music ability, attitude toward music, and the view of integrating music into the elementary classroom among pre-service elementary education majors enrolled in a music methods course.
Thus Richards wrote, The quality of singing experiences provided for students during formal schooling is important, not only for skill development but also for the attitude toward singing that is simultaneously developed (1999, p. 14).
Researchers have reported that efficacy beliefs influence career choices particularly for individuals in science and mathematics.
Concerning self-efficacy and teaching behavior, a better understanding of teacher behavior may result from examining teacher beliefs (Pajares, 1992).
Self-efficacy, according to Bandura, has strong influence over a persons attitude for certain tasks.
The interest and commitment of persons with low self-efficacy wanes during difficult tasks as they attribute failures to personal deficiencies and the obstacle they have to overcome.
According to this conceptual system, self-efficacy expectations affect both the initiation and the persistence of an individuals coping behavior.
The Teacher Efficacy Scale consisted of 30 items on a 6 point Likert scale which requires the participants to rate the degree to which they agree with each given statement ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree.
According to Saklofske, et al.
These same participants at the end of the study along with pre-service elementary teachers commented more on personality traits characteristic of teachers like stability, responsibility, productivity.
(1999) also reported that pre-service teachers who served as participants in this study entered their teacher preparation program with beliefs about teachers and student learning that underwent some apparent change.
Answering their proposed question, Rossman and Wilson wrote that both methods can play critical reciprocal roles in the analytical functions of corroboration, elaboration, and initiation (1985).

3. Why do elementary education majors pursue a degree in teaching?
One respondent indicated that she played recorder in intermediate school.
Although only one participant specifically mentioned friends as the people with whom she recalled in her music experience, additional responses included music experienced at school (51% of responses) and at church (8% of responses).
Specifically, the participants characterized the experience as having loved it (74% of responses), enjoyed it (16% of responses), and looked forward to it (11% of responses).
using music to build community), confidence in music integration with other subject areas, confidence in musical understanding in order to teach basic concepts of music, confidence in using appropriate music pedagogy, confidence in personal musicianship, and confidence in fostering student appreciation of music.
Future research would seem to benefit from investigating the complex relationship between teaching and teacher especially within the scope of music education.
After completing the music methods course, response means for these same items ranged from 4.09 4.87.
It seems from participants responses that music was not the focus of attention but the means to divert attention from something else entirely.
Item factor loadings for these two factors corresponded more consistently with 100 Texas Tech University, Jeremy J. Buckner, August 2008 previous research (Gibson & Dembo, 1984).
Although results of this analysis did not support the hypothesized model, results did indicate that Factor 1 seemed to relate to a belief in effective teaching to affect student achievement.
If this interpretation is correct, how does such an attitude affect music education advocacy among classroom teachers in public schools?
This is the point at which advocacy for music education really begins.
