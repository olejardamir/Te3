The majority of respondents, however, agree that music can improve achievement in other disciplines and are supportive of music integration.
When teaching music themselves, many IECTs revert to Eurocentric methods, strict discipline, and teacher- centered activities, even though they may demonstrate constructivist, democratic methods when teaching other subjects (Teicher, 1997; Wiggins & Wiggins, 2008).
Krehbiel (1990) found that fourth- and fifth-grade teachers in Illinois ranked the fine arts last in importance when compared to the other curricular areas defined by the state (language arts, mathematics, social studies, biology and physical sciences, physical development and health).
It is unclear what percent- age of schools taught music solely through specialists, classroom teachers, or various combinations because respondents could choose more than one category.
Affective integration involves using the arts to change the mood of individual students or the classroom as a whole (e.g., playing relaxing music after recess), whereas social integration involves using the arts to participate in school or community events, programs, or assemblies.
Preservice teachers, furthermore, rated goals related to creativity, entertainment, and interdisciplinary factors to be significantly more valuable than did their in-service colleagues.
Six research questions were examined: (a) What musical experiences and abilities do PECTs possess?
at Calvin College & Seminary on July 10, 2011jmt.sagepub.comDownloaded from 10 Journal	of	Music	Teacher	Education	19(2) Method A survey specifically for use in this study was developed following a review of the literature.
The final survey (see the appendix) consisted of 39 closed-response questions divided into four parts.
Each item in this section appeared in alphabetical order and included foreign language, health, language arts, math, music, physical education, reading, science, social studies, technology and computers, and visual art.
In Part IV, participants rated the importance of 13 possible extramusical (3), performance (4), and nonperformance (6) outcomes of the general music program.
A 7-step Likert-type scale was utilized for Parts II (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = somewhat disagree, 4 = no opinion, 5 = somewhat agree, 6 = agree, 7 = strongly agree), III, and IV (1 = very unimportant, 2 = unimportant, 3 = somewhat unim- portant, 4 = neither important nor unimportant, 5 = somewhat important, 6 = important, 7 = very important).
Of the respondents, 94% (n = 109; N = 116) reported 1 to 17 years (M = 7.48, Mo = 8, Mdn = 8, SD = 3.80) of formal music instruction through involvement in ensembles or private lessons.
Siebenaler, for example, found that only 51% of PECTs from a regional state university had participated in choir and that only 39% had played in band or orchestra.
It is also interesting that even fewer partici- pants (70.0%, n = 80) agree that the music specialist should integrate music and other subjects.
The general music teacher should 4.91 5 1.12 12.1 19.0 70.0 integrate content from other 14 22 80 subjects (i.e., social studies, math, reading) into music instruction.
These beliefs may result from a perceived lack of expertise in music pedagogy (e.g., Morin, 2004) or the fact that most respondents (92.2%, n = 107) were taught by a music specialist during their own elementary education and have not experienced music instruction delivered through any other model (e.g., Anderson & Piazza, 1996; Kagan, 1992).
It is unknown, however, if PECTs in this study experienced music integration in their own education or if their attitudes are the result of musical success and the teacher preparation program at Calvin College.
Attitudes regarding the importance of music reported by participants in this study concur with those of the general population.
A Gallup poll conducted in 2003 for the International Music Prod- ucts Association indicated that 95% of Americans consider music to be part of a well-rounded education, whereas 93% feel that schools should offer music education as part of the regular curriculum (Lyons, 2003).
It is likely that novice teachers enter the profession with a vision of education shaped by a number of influences including their own schooling and preservice preparation (Anderson & Piazza, 1996; Kagan, 1992).
This culture is likely established through a combination of external forces that may include the educational values of the community, an emphasis on at Calvin College & Seminary on July 10, 2011jmt.sagepub.comDownloaded from 14 Journal	of	Music	Teacher	Education	19(2) standardized test scores, and highly structured curricular goals in other subject areas.

The majority of participants, however, agree that music can improve achievement in other subjects and are supportive of music integration and their role in the process.
Most respondents feel comfortable integrating music with other disciplines and believe that they should.
It is likely that some classroom teachers will not do an adequate job teaching music because many do not feel responsible for or capable of doing so.
Elementary schools located in the western United States, or that have a minority student population of 50% or more, for example, are more likely than other schools to provide music instruction through IECTs.
Of respondents, 65% (n = 76), for example, are comfortable with their singing voice, whereas 46% (n = 53) possess the ability to play piano and/or guitarall useful skills in leading group singing.
Instructors at other colleges and universities, however, might consider using this questionnaire or a similar instrument to measure the attitudes and experiences of PECTs in their programs.
Additional stud- ies should also focus on the content and effectiveness of current music methods courses for PECTs in various colleges and universities to identify successful programs that may serve as models at other institutions.
The general	music	teacher should integrate content from other subjects (i.e., social studies, math, read- ing) into music instruction.
