the United States today operates primarily through a performance-based curriculum.
The better the literature, the more profound the experience will be for students, and the longer the impact and effects will last (Casey, 1993, p. 34).
The use and programming of literature of poor quality may result in an inferior quality of music education in the public schools.
The number of credit hours required in music theory, music history, pedagogy, conducting, and other areas varies among institutions.
6. What compositions, composers, and arrangers are discussed in band and/or orchestra literature courses?
Results from the study indicating that literature is either not being addressed or only marginally addressed may serve as a catalyst for 5additional research in order to address a serious omission in music education training.
If he does that, his efforts are self-defeating.
What is difficult is to find that easy music the conductor feels, Yes, these kids have to play this.
Now, how many Grade One or Grade Two pieces does the average director find that he can put his hand on his heart, look himself in the eye in the mirror, and say, My kids must play this piece.
(Casey, 1993, p. 36) 6If Music Education students do not receive adequate training in a basic literature base and in the literature selection process, then the quality of instruction they provide may suffer not due to inadequate teaching skills or instrumental knowledge, but to the possible selection of inferior quality music.
Why do music educators choose to play inferior music?
Through this handbook, the NASM provides recommendations and guidelines to colleges and universities regarding basic competencies that graduating music education majors should possess.
This study was based on an earlier study by Schmidt (1989).
Battisti (2002), while also discussing the historical development of the wind ensemble, includes information of a large number of compositions considered to be important works for the wind medium.
The term band referred to an ensemble of wind and percussion instruments consisting of instrumentation as defined by the symphonic band entry in the Harvard Dictionary of Music.
3. The course was an undergraduate course.
12 2. For those institutions requiring a course in band and/or orchestra literature, the following were considered: a. the number of credit hours awarded for completion of the literature course as a percentage of the total number of hours required in music courses for the degree and the overall total number of hours required for the degree b.
the number of credit hours awarded for completion of the elective course as a percentage of the total hours required in music courses for the degree and the overall total number of hours required for the degree c. the enrollment in the elective course as a percentage of the total number of instrumental music education majors d.
the indicated percentages of time spent on band and/or orchestra literature within other courses c. the number of credit hours awarded for completion of the course(s) including band and/or orchestra literature as a topic as a percentage of the total hours required in music courses for the degree and the overall total number of hours required for the degree d.
A major focus of the study was to determine the amount and type of instrumental literature instruction being required or offered to undergraduate instrumental music education majors.
The information collected from the 9 institutions indicating a required course(s) shows that Instrumental Literature instruction comprises a relatively small portion of the total curriculum (see Table 4).
If so, the percentage of instrumental music education majors choosing to enroll in the elective course(s) was also requested (see Table 9).

A list of names was provided from which each participant could select those discussed in the course(s).
A list of names was provided from which each participant could select those discussed.
An open response area was provided for participants to list additional orchestral composers discussed, but not included on the supplied list of names.
No additional composer names were provided in the open response area.
In addition, respondents indicated that the topic of band and orchestra literature accounted for an average of 21.7% of the time spent in those courses.
46 A comparison of the titles of required and elective courses in band and orchestra literature yielded no significant differences.
Texts and Materials The second portion of the questionnaire collected data relative to the actual instruction received by students in band and orchestra literature, regardless of the curricular placement of that instruction.
The literature commonly used in public school band and orchestra programs is generally graded according to a scale of 1 to 6, indicating the relative difficulty of each composition.
Due to the subjective nature of this grading system, discrepancies often occur from list to list.
When compared with responses provided on questions regarding specific band compositions discussed in literature courses, similar results were found.
Among Grade 2 compositions, the most frequently included works were Air for Band by Frank Erickson, who was the sixth most popular band composer, and Kentucky 1800 by Clare Grundman, who was the eighth most popular band composer.
This was found to be the case among responses received in this study.
In addition to being the five most frequently occurring band compositions, the composers of these works were all among the six most frequently discussed band composers.
Due to a small number of responses regarding frequently discussed orchestral compositions, no significant correlation could be found between works and composers.
The results indicated listening, score study, and class discussion 51 were the three most frequently used methods, with listening receiving the highest percentage of responses (67.9%).
The ability of music educators to make informed decisions regarding the compositions used as the core of instrumental music programs can be a significant factor in the quality of instruction provided.
