A 2003 study by Chorus America finds that 23.5 million American adults sing weekly in choral organizations in the United States.
Choral singing far outshines other arts activities such as drama, dance, painting or drawing.

In 1995, the Music Educators National Conference (now MENC: the National Association for Music Education) under the leadership of Will Schmid, initiated a meeting with other choral organizations active in the United States to discuss the state of singing in America.
The report also examines attitudes and motivations of choral singers, and establishes general characteristics and influences of these singers in their communities.
Results gleaned from these studies of adult singers are discussed here in combination with the results from the national surveys by NEA (1998a) and Chorus America (2003).

Two studies involved the Northwest: Buness (1979) in Montana, and Holmquist (1995) in Oregon.
The Chorus America 2003 report states: The lists, however, were not representative of the whole universe of choral singers in the United States.
Vincents survey (1997) was also by mail; 21 of 25 choruses responded (N =631 singers).
Tipps (1992) had a contact person within each of 10 choruses administer the survey at a rehearsal, and return the collected surveys by mail for a response rate of 80% (N=435).
Simmons visited rehearsals of 15 community choirs, and choir members returned the survey by mail (N=495; 50% return rate).
Response rate was higher for those who administered and collected the survey during the rehearsal hour, as is the case of Bell (2000) with an 87% return rate (N=457) from 10 choruses, Holmquist (1995) surveyed three community choirs: Choir 1, at rehearsal (response rate: 94%); Choir 2, at rehearsal with a follow-up mailing (response rate: 86%); Choir 3, mailing only (response rate: 67%).
The Chorus America study (2003) coordinated several research components: two national random phone surveys of the general public (N=1000 per poll); six focus groups with choral singers (N=71) from three regions; and in-depth telephone interview of randomly selected professional and volunteer choral singers (N=623).

Profile of the Adult Amateur Singer Demographic Information Based on the existing research, the following generalizations can be made about the adult amateur singer.
However, as these percentages are based on active community chorus singers, where women outnumber the men by a 2:1 ratio, the disparity of numbers between men and women as these singers grow older grows wider, states Vincent (1997, p. 143).
Higher education statistics ranged from two-thirds completing a four-year college education, to one- Bell (2004) International Journal of Research in Choral Singing 2(1).
An interesting finding by the NEA (1998a) is that African Americans as a demographic group demonstrated the highest rate of personal participation in choral singing (26%) when compared to other races and other available arts activities.
Several dissertation studies report income levels of community choir singers (Simmons, 1962; Spell, 1989; Vincent, 1997), but it is difficult to draw conclusions from this information, as incomes evolve over time and geography.
Chorus America (2003) reports a near inverse proportion of percentages: 24% of the singers with incomes up to $50,000, and 63% of the singers with incomes over $50,000.
17), visiting museums and attending music and theatre performances (p.
Choral singers are involved in the political process; 93% vote regularly in both local and national elections, and 42% make contributions to political parties or candidates (p.
73% of choral singers attend religious services at least once a week (p.

Community Choirs 46 Green (1998) pursued the issue of perceived levels of enhanced musical literacy attained by singers in choruses.
Chorus America (2003) found that 34% of respondents belong to two choruses, and 10% belong to three or more choruses.
Holmquist (1995) also discovered a 64% rate of involvement with church choirs.
There may be social motives but the musical motive is invariably stronger.
An initial investigation by Simmons (1962) presents influences and motivations explaining adult participation in community choirs in the Detroit area.
Singers attribute their adulthood singing to an enjoyment of musical participation and public performance, a desire to increase musical skills, and a perspective of choral singing as recreation.
Bell (2004) International Journal of Research in Choral Singing 2(1).
Furthermore, these singers also showed a past involvement in high school performing ensembles and a pattern of increasing musical involvement.

In addition, singers explain they come from families where music was valued and where musical experiences were made available, and parents or guardians were most influential in developing their interest in music.

In North America, Chorus America is the national organization for 700 independent choruses, including professional choruses, volunteer choruses, children/youth choruses, and symphony/opera choruses.
The international and multi-lingual Internet resource ChoralNet (http://www.choralnet.
Clearly, daily Internet access and swift creation of Web pages has helped accelerate this communication among singers and ensembles, in ways one could not fathom only ten years ago.
Well-established choirs in or near East Coast cities, such as Boston, New York and Philadelphia, are often the subject of historical documentation (see Johnson, 1965; Krehbeil, 1970; Walters, 1971; Perkins & Dwight, 1977).
Information gleaned from archival studies will strengthen existing choirs and illustrate patterns of success for those forming new choirs.
It is important to expand and develop the choral research agenda into this population of 23.5 million singers.
Another suggestion for increasing male singer retention is proposed by Vincent (1997): the creation of small vocal ensembles at the middle school level that provide opportunities for individual attention.
The visible lack of racial diversity in community choirs is an enigma.
14), and that positive school experiences, including effective teaching and social acceptance, are accountable for their continuing involvement (p.
Case studies will provide intensive knowledge of the individual adult singer.
The opportunity is ripe to examine exactly how and what our music education programs accomplish and how we as choral conductors can continue to address the musical needs of adult amateur singers in community choirs.
