Many American cities have attempted to gather key information about the situation of arts learning in order to help them understand and improve childrens access to high-quality arts learning experiences.
The Coalition thanks the Canadian Principals Association, the Canadian Music Educators Association, the Canadian Education Association, the Ontario Principals Council, the Catholic Principals Council of Ontario, and lAssociation des directions et directions adjointes des coles franco-ontariennes (ADFO) for their assistance in distributing information about this survey to their members.
A DELICATE BALANCE From the survey data and respondents written-in comments, it is clear that successful music programs rely on a delicate balance.
It is also vital to have support from school boards and provincial education departments, as well as a broader community that values music.
I know of another school in our district where the teacher is an Orff specialist and may have to give up his music classroom.
A positive sign regarding the situation of music education: a majority of respondents ranked each of the 13 potential benefits as very important.
Funding of music education has clearly not kept pace with demand.
Parental support, in particular, is a key to success.
It is also vital to have support from school boards and provincial education departments, as well as a broader community that values music.
Fundraising, parents, school councils and student fees are the primary funding sources for music education in over one-third of schools.
The perceptions of the benefits of music education, while positive, are still most strongly understood by teachers who see the impact on their students first-hand.
We need to engage school boards and school principals with our campaigns, along with parents, teachers and community leaders who will act on behalf of our children.
5. Better training for generalist teachers through universities Teacher readiness both pre-service and in-service is a very large challenge.
Our universities in general need to be doing a better job of providing teachers with the necessary skills to teach music effectively.
The median (or typical) response time was 19 minutes.
In general, this will limit the maximum margin of error to about +/- 12 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.
The remainder of this report includes information based on the weighted responses.
1 Respondents were asked to indicate which grades are offered at their school, with checkboxes for Junior Kindergarten through Grade 12 (and equivalent selections in Quebec).
Music is taught as part of a more general arts curriculum in a very high proportion of Saskatchewan schools (60%).
Another 15% of elementary schools indicated that between 76% and 95% of their student population participates in a music class or program in the formal timetable.3 Participation in a music class or program is much lower in secondary schools.
3 The 2005 survey found that On average, almost two-thirds of students participate in a music class or program when it is in the formal timetable.
This is the highest level in Canada.
In Quebec, secondary schools offer an average of 4.2 music opportunities to their students.
Elementary schools There are some differences between elementary and secondary schools.
A positive sign regarding the situation of music education: a majority of respondents ranked each of the 13 potential benefits as very important.
Purpose-built music facilities are available in one-third of schools, including 61% of secondary schools and only 25% of elementary schools.
Only about 20% of schools in these provinces believe that their music programs need improvement.
How would you rate the support for music education at your school from other members of the community?
This would be the foundation of a responsible adult who can contribute in a meaningful way to society.
It is my belief that every principal, through creative timetabling, can have a music specialist teach all the students in the school.
Very few responding schools have 1,000 students or more.
As such, the statistics for this size of school are not reliable.
24% of schools ranked lack of time / timetable pressures first.
Lack of suitable teaching space is an equally-significant challenge in elementary and secondary schools.
In Saskatchewan, the top three challenges are the same as the national results: Funding is the most important challenge in 26% of schools.
In Quebec, lack of time is the most significant challenge: Lack of time / timetable pressures is the most important challenge in 31% of schools (one of the highest levels in Canada, along with Nova Scotia and New Brunswick/PEI).
La musique est l'enfant pauvre des coles.
Funding of music education has clearly not kept pace with demand.
Instructional space: 16% of schools indicated that instructional space improved (either a little or a lot), another 74% noted that instructional space stayed the same, and 10% indicated that instructional space decreased (either a little or a lot).
In all other areas, a majority of Newfoundland schools reported no changes.
In contrast to the positive changes in Newfoundland and Manitoba, funding for music education decreased in many British Columbia schools: 34% of B.C. schools reported decreases in funding, while only 11% reported improvements.
Most commonly, this was a dont know response.
Five percent (or less) of schools ranked each of the seven other options as their most desired improvement to music education.
Offering more music classes: 13% of elementary schools ranked offering more music classes as the #1 potential improvement.
