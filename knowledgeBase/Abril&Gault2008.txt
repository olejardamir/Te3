How effective do principals think music programs are in helping students attain specific learning outcomes and broad educational goals?
However, this support has not resulted in an increase of arts offerings at schools throughout the country.
Results also showed a disparity in arts education offerings, with students in high-poverty schools having less access to arts programs than their counterparts in more affluent school districts.
For instance, principals believed that students learn to perform and listen attentively through the study of music more so than they learn to compose and create their own music.
A final item in this study asked principals to indicate the degree to which 10 variables affected their music programs.
3. What are secondary school principals perceptions of broad educational goals as they are currently being met?
The second section of the survey consisted of seven music learning outcomes, loosely based on those found in the National Standards for Music Education (e.g., perform music, create and compose music).
The sample was proportionally stratified to reflect the proportion of members in each of four major regions of the United States and so that the sample might closely reflect the population.
A small incentive (wrapped tea bag) was included in the second mailer as a token of appreciation for completing the survey.

Respondents indicated what percentage of their student bodies qualified for free and reduced-price meals, resulting in the following: 0% to 25% (46% of schools), 26% to 50% (33% of schools), and more than 50% (21% of schools).
Results Profiles Virtually all of the schools surveyed offered some music course taught by a spe- cialist (98%), yet music was a required course in only 34% of those schools.
There was a significant difference by school location, F(2, 477) = 12.61, p < .001, but post hoc analysis revealed significant differences only between suburban and rural schools.
A handful of principals indicated that they offered other types of courses, including: Caribbean Ensemble, Brazilian Ensemble, African Drumming, Bluegrass, Celtic Music, Musical Theater, and Math-as-Music.
This score was calculated by adding the numbers of different courses that principals indicated were currently being offered.
Section 3 of the survey sought to determine principals perceptions of broad educational goals as they were being met in their respective schools.
Means and standard deviations for these ratings are found in Table 4. Mean scores indicate that No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and standardized tests had the most negative impact on music programs, with scores below the midpoint.
Chi-square analyses were used to test for differences in the ways principals per- ceived these 10 variables to be impacting music programs: highly positive/positive, no effect, and negative/highly negative.
Of the variables, four (budgeting, scheduling, NCLB, and standardized tests) were perceived to be negatively impacting music programs in more than 25% of schools.
The results from this section of the survey were compared to the open-ended responses that asked principals to describe the greatest obstacles they face in supporting the music program and any other comments they would like to share.
Several respondents provided multi- ple answers, resulting in a total of 468 statements.
These statements fell into seven general categories: (a) financial/budgetary (32.5% of total responses); (b) scheduling/ time (19.9% of total responses); (c) outside pressures (testing, legislation, upper administration, community attitudes; 15.4% of total responses); (d) staffing (10.9% of total responses); (e) no obstacles (9.2% of total responses); (f) unique character- istics of the school such as decreasing enrollment, socioeconomic status of the pop- ulation, or special focus of the school (i.e., alternative school; 7.1% of total Abril, Gault / Secondary School Music 75 Table 3 Means, Standard Deviations, and Confidence Intervals for Each Broad Educational Goal in Current Circumstances Future Cooperation/ Self- Lifelong Involvement Artistic Teamwork Esteem Creativity Learning With Arts Sensitivity Diversion M 4.59 4.50 4.41 4.31 4.31 4.29 4.27 SD 0.58 0.65 0.67 0.71 0.70 0.65 0.84 Confidence 0.05 0.06 0.06 0.06 0.06 0.06 0.07 interval Self- Critical Heritage/ Tolerance Expression Intelligence Thinking Interdisciplinary Culture of Others M 4.27 4.21 4.07 3.96 3.90 3.84 SD 0.73 0.73 0.85 0.79 0.87 0.81 Confidence 0.06 0.06 0.07 0.07 0.07 0.07 interval at UNIV WASHINGTON LIBRARIES on January 9, 2009 http://jrm.sagepub.comDownloaded from 76 Journal of Research in Music Education responses); and (g) facilities/equipment (5.1% of total responses).1 The findings are consistent with principal responses on Section 4 of the survey form, in which NCLB, standardized testing, financial issues, and schedule-related issues were cited as hav- ing a more negative impact on the ability to effectively implement a school music program than other variables.
Specific responses that cited NCLB (No Child Left Behind has devastated our Industrial Art, Music, Business and Vocational programs.
For respondents who cited financial issues, one frequently described concern related to districtwide financial problems (The biggest obstacle at this time is a shrinking budget with a huge deficit caused by our states QED law).
Respondents who cited time or scheduling issues dis- cussed the challenges related to fitting all classes within the daily schedule (Scheduling issues have kept many out of music) or competing activities (Our students are committed to too many activities, some are forced to make choices, and music is often times removed) as contributors to limited support for music at the secondary level.
Of concern however was that only a portion of those schools (34%) had a specific music course requirement.
This might simply be due to the fact that these courses were offered less frequently.
It could also reflect principals desire to involve more students in music through expanded course offerings, a possible sign of value toward music education.
This finding is consistent with prior research in arts education (Illinois Creates, 2006; NCES, 2002) and further supports the notion that students in rural schools do not necessarily have access to the same arts education experiences as those in suburban or urban areas.
This is similar to findings reported nationwide for the 1999-2000 academic year (NCES, 2002) and in California schools, indicating that students in high-poverty schools had less access to arts programs than their counterparts of more affluence (Woodworth et al., 2007).
Although they may frequently see evidence of performing in their music programs, observing students develop skills as composers is usually less obvious to principals who do not observe the everyday activities of a music classroom (Abril & Gault, 2007).
The final section of the survey sought to uncover the impact of certain variables on a given music program.
Principals considered music teachers to have the greatest positive impact on a program.
Very few principals considered either of these to have a positive impact on the music program.
