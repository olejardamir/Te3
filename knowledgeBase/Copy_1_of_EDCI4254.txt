I am very pleased that our students will again have the opportunity to work in Montgomery County elementary schools and I hope that each of you will find it convenient to assist with our teacher education program.
Since this is a unique field experience model, I will briefly explain the schedules and responsibilities of our students.
You will have one student two half days per week (Tues.
& Thurs.) for ten weeks.
During this time the student intern will be prepared to assist you with your teaching responsibilities.
For example, the teaching assistant might set up the room, lead the class in movement activities, hand singing, or assist with recorder, ukulele, etc. This is not a student teaching experience; for most students it is their first field experience.
The experience is an extension of the concurrent elementary music methods class.
However, if you feel that the student intern is capable of assuming responsibility for some of your classes, please allow them to do so.
We encourage our students to get as much hands on experience as possible.
It will be the responsibility of the individual students to inform you of any schedule changes or attendance conflicts and to adjust their visitation schedules accordingly.
Dr. Stephen King will be assisting me with student observation and evaluation.
Your first student intern will arrive on Tuesday, September 17.
Thank you for your time and cooperation.
I look forward to visiting your classrooms.
