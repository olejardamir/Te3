Then, in the final section, we raise some of the questions facing the system in the context of a decade of austerity and Cuba's growing participation in the global economy.
High Levels of Non-salary Expenditures Cuba has invested substantial resources in non-salary items.
In March 1999, teachers received a 30 percent salary increase, a move that decreases the resources available for non-salary costs.
Teacher motivation and retention are also threatened by de- creases in the purchasing power of salaries and the attractiveness of new professional ctivities, especially in tourism and in foreign firms, as evidenced by teacher attrition of 4 to 8 percent per year in the eastern oriental provinces, where tourism is more developed.
Greater investments or allocation of resources to education as an isolated strategy do not necessarily bring better educational results.

They spend about 80 percent of their time with students at school and the rest of their time in student's homes.
Teachers visit parents and identify families with potential problems as well as families able to host a group of students.

However, competition in Cuba is called emulation because it is not considered an end in itself, but a method for self-improvement, developed through solidarity and collaboration among peers.
The Parents Council is part of the School Council (Consejo de Direccion).
Curriculum, teacher didactics, and research are centered on environmental conservation and rural develop- ment.
Several teachers each year submit applied research papers for the Pedagogia congress, related to specific local environmental problems, such as energy saving habits, low-cost machinery, and technologies such as solar energy.
As a result, the government has developed explicit strategies for reaching children unlikely to be well-served by the standard school model, in particular children living in isolated rural areas, i.e., mountainous areas, as well as children with disabilities and other special needs.
Teachers and families are trained on how to receive and work with the children.
) Compensatory schemes provide stability to the education system and social cohesion, which is so neces- sary in a society.
Before 1959 there were eight special education centers in Cuba.18 Now the country has 425 special schools enrolling 57,000 children and employing 13,000 teachers (out of a total school population of 2,300,000).
Every student in secondary school is involved in agriculture work two hours per week (for example, planting trees in a wood nearby, or working in the school agriculture garden), two hours on music, and two hours in military preparation.

Here the Marxist principle of combining study and work is applied to school gardens (las huertas escolares).
In the early years of the Revolution, Cuba developed secondary schools in the countryside (escuelas secundanas basicas en el campo, ESBEC) boarding schools as a major initiative to bridge the gap be- tween rural and urban populations.
Notes from the Education Unit, Sustainable Develop- ment Department, IDB, 28 July 1999.
As part of the curriculum, students are prepared to defend themselves from natural disasters and military aggression during military preparation activities.
Students are selected for university during school assemblies, with parents participating.
That these results were obtained after a decade of economic upheaval attests to the strength of Cuba's investment in educa- tion.
