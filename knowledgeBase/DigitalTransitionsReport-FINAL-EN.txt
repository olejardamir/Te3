17 Media Arts - Digital Arts/Digital Media/New Media/Interactive Media .....................
Most funders are interested in using social media more effectively to communicate with artists and the public.
This report is intended to help Canadian public arts funders better understand how the transition to a digital society has an impact on the arts, in order to guide them as they develop strategies to ensure that the arts sector is not left behind in the digital age.
The project was intended to address the following key questions: What opportunities and challenges is the digital transition creating for the arts (artists, arts organizations, arts funders) and the public?
Throughout the project, the consultant worked with Sophie Le-Phat Ho, a researcher who reviewed French-language material and carried out interviews in French.
The consultant concentrated on material written in English.
The review focussed on books, articles, websites and blogs relating to the impact of new technologies on the arts and included material from sources in government, colleges and universities, the research departments of international funding agencies and from artists organizations.
Outline the characteristics of the digital world, making a distinction before core characteristics and those that have been influenced by societies and economies.
In material we sent to artists and arts funders, we described digital technologies as technologies that allow information and processes to be created and stored in digital form, with the possibility of distribution over electronic networks.
Consequently, it may be difficult to distinguish between what is recorded and what is fabricated.
As soon as artwork is on a network it is available instantaneously wherever the network reaches.
Inter-connectivity also makes it possible to track who is receiving information and to have accurate information on what is seen and what is ignored.
The costs of basic digital hardware/software have been stabilizing while their power has been increasing, putting basic digital hardware and software within the financial reach of many artists.
The Hype Curve is described in greater detail in Annex 1. The world of digital networks is dynamic.
As Joel also points out, the range of material that is available online is expanding too.
Social media are regarded as powerful because they allow artists to reach the specific audiences that are interested in what the artists make.
16 The Long Tail Many discussions of the role of social media in reaching niche audiences mention the theory of the Long Tail.
17 F. IMPACT BY ARTISTIC DISCIPLINE/PRACTICE Introduction Increasing interest - The staff of two CPAF member organizations we interviewed emphasized that the majority of applications from artists and arts organizations continue to be for approaches which are not heavily influenced by digital technologies.

Websites that are recognized as artistic face the problem of being found among hundreds of thousands of other sites.
However, machinima and modding use existing game elements to produce original artistic work.
Others are recognized in specialized online and offline festivals.

Some artists are seeking to invent their own platforms in order to create and disseminate their artwork.
Is there a possibility for using social media to attract the attention of communities of interest?

Books - The major value of a publisher is editorial vision.
It does offer options for short runs but is generally still too expensive on a per unit basis or too limited in the formats offered to work in any substantive way for most trade publishers.
If a publisher does not provide the value added of editorial oversight, what is their contribution to the artistic process?

Many organizations sites serve multiple purposes and target multiple audiences.
Other key activities include watching or listening to a clip of an arts performance or exhibition (16%) while a further 8% had watched or listened to a full arts performance.
Many see online and offline arts as an either or, where developments in the arts online can only come at the cost of offline art.
However, there is currently little sense that active participation in creating art will increase greatly in the future.
This funder also stated that a freeze on capital spending has stalled the move towards online applications at present.
One funder uses public radio and would like to use community TV to reach the public.
Respondents from one funding agency pointed out differences in opinion on copyright among artists that break down along age, wealth and community lines.
Are funders tracking the changing roles of infrastructure organizations (artist-run centres, publishers, recording studios, etc.) in light of digital technologies?
Do funding agencies recognize the roles of new kinds of professionals who help artists/organizations use social media and digital technologies effectively?
