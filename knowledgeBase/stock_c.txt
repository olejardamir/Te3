2 Significance of Study .............................................................................
Selected literature 2published between 1995 and 2001 by experts in the field of music education or arts education policy is presented.
The research question being addressed is; What are experts in the music education and arts education policy fields currently writing about the role of the National Standards for Arts Education as relates to music education policy reform?
This policy document decrees that standards for art education are important for two reasons: They help define what a good education in the arts should provide: a thorough grounding in a basic body of knowledge and the skills required both to make sense and make use of the arts disciplines.
Elliot Eisner, in his book Cognition and Curricula Revisited, noted that frequently the purpose of the standards is misunderstood at the local level.
He states that the school changes the incoming message more than the incoming message changes the school (1994).
As stated by June Hinckley, the current President of the Music Educators National Conference, Arts educators cannot rely on 4outside groups to take care of them and their role in the education of young people.
Susan Byo, after completing an extensive study on the perceived ability of classroom teachers to implement the National Standards, made a similar comment: Despite media attention and integration of the standards into state and local curricula, little progress has been made at the school-based level in the development and implementation of an organizational design through which these standards might be achieved (Byo, 1997, p.30).
During these four decades, several events and advocacy documents helped to pave the path that led to creation of national standards for education.
When the national economy declined in the early 1970s, MENC targeted policy makers in their music education advocacy efforts.
As a response to this, CNAEA successfully received a grant that was designed to determine what the nations children should know and be able to do in the arts.
Shortly after these arts standards were announced, each of the individual arts organizations created their own similar set of standards that applied specifically to their arts area.
These documents are The School Music Program: A New Vision and Opportunity-to-Learn Standards for Music Instruction: Grades PreK-12.
To further explain what he meant by this and to define the role of the researcher in the research process, Krippendorff presents the following theoretical framework within which content analysis takes place: 1. There is a set of data as communicated to the researcher.
He offers the following steps for the practical procedure of the content analysis process: 1. Obtain the initial body of raw data.
The disciplinary areas researched for the study were limited to K-12 music education and arts education policy.
Keywords searched for all databases were arts policy, arts education, arts education policy, music education, music curriculum, music policy, national policy, national educational policy, and educational reform.

Finally, the cards were sorted into the nine categories and entered into a computer to form a table.
Articles are presented chronologically from 1995-2001.

The national standards will certainly play an important role in initial teacher certification because states will want to make sure that candidates have mastered the knowledge and skills they will be expected to teach.

25 Description The current focus on voluntary national standards for arts education is examined.
Independence in the classroom has been a strong selling point in recruiting good teachers.
b.
My conclusion is that without empirical research, without assessments that answer high-stake questions about students and programs, and without serious policy analyses that explore ramifications and help avoid the potholes, the proposed curricular changes required by the new standards remain today's education fad and are not sufficient reason to abandon arts programs, whose continued and renewed success may require only the restoration of adequate resources--primarily time and priority--and inspired teachers.

Each of these seems to work against each other.

Given the context of the early years of the twenty-first century, music educators-faced with a plethora of outcomes trumpeted by advocates-were forced to define the knowledge and skill base of the discipline or lose control of music as a curricular subject.

Four key issues were defined by the National State Board Association (NSBA) as having an impact on school governance in the near future.

4. Research a. Research has profound implications for school governance because school boards must invest their resources where they will get the greatest return in raising student achievement...

Standards are not necessarily what are most valued in the arts.
The categorys location is indicative of its relationship to the three overarching themes.
Intelligent inferences are then proposed about their relationship to the National Standards for Music Education as they relate to the future of music education policy reform.
Although the efforts of the standards have received national and state support, more work must be done at the local level.
Standards based programs without assessment have diminished value.
5. Reading and notating music.
6. Listening to, analyzing, and describing music.
As a result, the joy of experiencing the arts is enriched and matured by the discipline of learning and the pride of accomplishment.
This includes knowledge and skills in the use of the basic vocabularies, materials, tools, techniques, and intellectual methods of each arts discipline.
